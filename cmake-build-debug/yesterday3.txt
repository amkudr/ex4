 23 All my trouble seemed so far away
 23 Now it looks as though they're here to stay
 23 Oh, I believe in yesterday
 23 Suddenly
 23 I'm not half the man I used to be
 23 There's a shadow hanging over me
 23 Oh, yesterday came suddenly
 23 Why she had to go, I don't know
 23 She wouldn't say
 23 I said something wrong
 23 Now I long for yesterday

 23 Now I need a place to hide away
 23 Oh, I believe in yesterday
 23 Why she had to go, I don't know
 23 She wouldn't say
 23 I said something wrong
 23 Now I long for yesterday
